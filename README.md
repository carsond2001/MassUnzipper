# MassUnzipper
Given a directory, this python program will unzip all zip or rar files within a folder. 
The purpose of this is to unzip files and make sure all the content is moved to the main folder.
A good example of this is if a zip has 2 folders in it, the content in the 2 folder will be moved to the main directory
